/// Locations are places that data can be stored
///
/// Sqlite: Sqlite is a location and can store data in series of tables columns and rows
/// 
/// Air: Air servers are locations that store data in a tree
///      Air servers also require a protocol for each node in the tree
///
/// CRD: All locations need to accept a create, read, and delete calls using just paths
///
/// Paths: Paths are used to identify a particular spot in the data tree Vec<String>
///
/// All locations have a custom trait that must be implemented
/// They can have a custom derive macro to make it easy or blanket implementations
/// 


/// Data

/// Data is a tree with nodes that are either a field or a map

/// State

/// field is the latest
/// alt: api calls need to be carried out on sub data

///Update
